This directory contains Supporting Information files and ITP files of all simulations discussed in the article. 

Supporting Information
This directory contains (besides this README.txt) three folders (Rod Binding Dimer, Twister Binding Dimer, and Beta Strand Dimer) that contain files with the atomic coordinates (in PDB format) of aS structures discussed in the article. An additional folder (Parameter Files) contains mdp files of parameter settings for GROMACS simulations.
